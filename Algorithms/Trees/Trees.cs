    /*
     * A 'Tree' data structure is similar to a linked list, as each node has a reference to the previous and next
     * Where lists, arrays, stacks, and queues are linear structures with only 1 element that follows the previous, a
     * tree can have multiple elements that are next, as it can branch out in different ways.
     * The tree data structure can be useful in many cases:
     * - Hiarchical data - file systems, organizational models, etc.
     * - Databases - For quick retrieval
     * - Routing Tables - used for routing data in network algorithms
     * - Sorting/Searching - sorting and searching for data
     * - Priority queues - a priority queue system is commonly implemented using tree (e.g. binary heaps)
     *
     * Terminology
     * Tree - The whole structure
     * Root Node - The Node at the very top of the tree
     * Edges - the connections between nodes
     * Nodes - the individual data points
     * Leaf nodes - nodes which don't have any child nodes, are therefore at the end of a branch
     * Child nodes - any node that is subsequent another node
     * Parent node - the previous node, any node can only have 1 parent
     * Tree height - Number of edges from a Leaf node to the Root node
     * Tree size - Total number of nodes
     *
     * Types of Trees
     * Some base types of trees include:
     * - Binary Tree - Each node can only have 2 child nodes. Base for more complex tree structures,
     * - Binary Search Trees - Type where the left child node has a lower value, and the right child has a higher
     * - AVL Trees - A type of tree that self-balances so that every node the difference in height between left- and right subtree
     * is a most 1. Is maintained through rotations upon deleting/inserting
