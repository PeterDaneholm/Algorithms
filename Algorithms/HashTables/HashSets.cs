    /* Hash Sets
     * A Hash Set is a type of Hash Table that usually holds a larger number of elements
     * Search, add, and removing elements are still very fast though
     *
     * A Hash set cannot have more than 1 element with the same value!
     *
     * We can run into scenarios, where the hash function places all the values in the same bucket, which is definitely not ideal.
     * In worst case scenarios, we can end up with a time complexity of O(n), which is the same as for arrays and linked lists.
     * Therefore it's very important to design the hash function so it will distribute the values into all the buckets.
     * Also remember to utilize all buckets and only have about as many as hash set elements, as having too many is a waste of memory and having too few is a waste of time.
